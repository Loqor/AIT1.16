# Bugs:
 - `Door Switch Control` is bugging out the door when trying to open the door via using it.
 - Seems like `Door Switch Control`'s and TARDIS door logic is generally broken
 - How does exactly `Exterior Facing Control` work...?
 - `Toyota Monitor`'s renderer is broken
 - When changing exteriors, the portal doesn't change its sizes, so you can see the back of the door
 - `Coordinate Control`'s renderer is also broken
 - When closing TARDIS' door, the portal disappears right before the animation ends, the player can see the back of the door
 - `Coordinate Control` beeps regarding of where you click
 - I have managed to open the door right after the landing, and the portal wasn't created
 - TARDIS has travelled into blocks
